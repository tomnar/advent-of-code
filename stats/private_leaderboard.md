# Private leaderboard
The company I work for created its own leaderboard. The first to complete a task gets 10 points, the next to finish gets 9, and so on.  
The X-axis represents the date written horizontally, and the Y-axis represents the total score. Other participants' names have been removed for privacy.

## Legend
\* = gold star, both tasks solved (up to 20 points).  
o = silver star, first task solved (up to 10 points).  
. = no task solved.
